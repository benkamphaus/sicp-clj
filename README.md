# sicp-clj

This is mostly a learning/practice example as I revisit SICP lecture material online.

Clojure examples drawn from: (1) The MIT SICP course, (2) Brian Harvey's SICP course from Berkeley, (3) the SICP textbook.

Clojure is not Scheme - don't expect things to translate identically. At times there will be a mix of transliterated and more idiomatic implementations of the same concept.

You may have noticed that Clojure deviates from Scheme and the SICP courses in some of its core design philosophy. At some point I plan to explore these boundaries more.
